Gatho Matrix Bot
================

A Matrix bot which synchronises RSVP reactions to and announcements from Gatho - a simple event
hosting tool hosted at [https://gatho.party](https://gatho.party).

Contributions are very welcome. I encourage other event planning apps to adopt this bot (or a fork
or alternative) to integrate with Matrix - an open, well funded, well supported
communication protocol with [dozens](https://matrix.org/clients/) of compatible clients.

# Current features
